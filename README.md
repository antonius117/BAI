# Blood and Iron mod
Blood and Iron is a major overhaul mod for Victoria 2: Heart of Darkness. It's based on NNM and includes various reworked elements from other mods or minimods such as Vickymod, PDM etc. The main focus is on fixing, improving and balancing the game and expanding it with more gameplay mechanics, as well as to make the game more historical and realistic by adding more major and important historical events and nations in a way that it doesn't become too bloated and railroaded, as it also focuses on what-if scenarios and alternate outcomes if the player decides to follow a different path, and to make every country interesting and fun to play by adding more flavor events.
