EVTNAME44360;Louis Riel Gains Public Notice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44360;The noted Louis Riel has become a figurehead amongst his people. He calls for increased rights for Metis people across Canada. Unique among his number, the young Riel has quickly risen to prominence due to his eloquent speech, his education, and his earnest beliefs. Leaving him alive would be a great example of Canada's freedom of speech, but the government can pull a few strings in order to effect a policy beneficial to the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC44361;The Anglo-Canadian gentleman William McDougall has been proposed to be the Lieutenant Governor of the troubled Rupert's Land/North West Territories. His invaluable service and experience in the past puts him in a prime position to manage the territories, but some believe his anti-French and Anti-Metis policies to be too heavy-handed for the troubled territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44362;The Red River Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44362;The Red River Rebellion, later referred to as the First Riel Rebellion, was a rebellion that occurred soon after Canadian Confederation. The Canadian Government had installed an anti-French and anti-Metis lieutenant governor, William McDougall, in the newly-bought North West Territory. When McDougall sent surveyors into what would eventually be the province of Manitoba, the restless Metis inhabitants sent their own delegation to intercept these surveyors and proclaimed the existence of the Metis Confederation. Historically, they established a provisional government in the new Confederation, which the Canadian Government tolerated while the situation developed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44363;The Execution of Thomas Scott;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44363;Thomas Scott, an Orangeman of Irish descent, was executed by Louis Riel during the Red River Rebellion for conspiring against the self-proclaimed Metis provisional government. Historically, Riel wished to show the world that the Metis peoples were demanding to be taken seriously, but the Canadian Government viewed this action by Riel as a step too far and outfitted the Wolseley Expedition to quell the Rebellion. After conflicts with the Metis, Louis Riel was captured and exiled to the United States. With this, the Red River Rebellion was crushed, but the Metis and Native peoples would not soon forget this act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44363;Our hands are tied. Outfit the expedition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44364;The Return of Louis Riel and the Second Riel Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44364;After being elected to parliament three times in absentia after his exile, Louis Riel returned to Canada in 1884. Using increased Metis and Native cohesion, the ailing Riel managed to assemble a loose coalition to reattempt his rebellion for Metis independence in 1885. Historically, this rebellion was a failure due to internal strife amongst Rebellion leaders, an increasingly ill and megalomaniacal Riel, and increased Federal cohesion. Canada was no longer a fledgling nation just getting on its feet, and quickly moved to wipe out Riel and his rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44365;Louis Riel's Fate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44365;Historically, after surrendering to the Canadian forces after his failed rebellion, the Canadian Government held a quick trial in what can be best called a kangaroo court. Held in a hostile city before a jury of purely Anglo-Canadian Protestant jurors, the Catholic Metis Louis Riel was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death after a trial lasting only five days. Louis Riel refused to plea insanity, instead delivering two heartfelt speeches to the court, and later asserting to his lawyer that "Life, without the dignity of an intelligent being, is not worth having." Louis Riel was hanged on the 18th of September, 1885. His rebellions and the spirit of the Metis would largely die with him, but in due time he would be remembered as a folk hero amongst White, Metis, and Native people alike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME203700;The Republican Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203700;The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. To avert a republican backlash, the government adopted a series of credit and military policies and reforms to appease the land owners. The measures made by the government alarmed the civilian republicans and the Positivists in the military corps. They saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. For them, it had become a case of "now or never". Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring the Positivist officers to overthrow the monarchy. The Positivists launched a coup d'etat and tried to institute a republic on November 15, 1889. During the whole ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome.

EVTNAME203701;The Golden Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203701;The Lei Áurea (Golden Law) was sanctioned by Isabel, Imperial Princess of Brazil, who was regent at the time while her father, Emperor Dom Pedro II, was in Europe. It was signed on May 13, 1888 and was the law that abolished slavery in Brazil. It had only two articles. The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves  Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. The Brazilian government was also under pressure from Britain, who sought to end the slave trade in order to expand production in its own colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME203702;The Rise of Getulio Vargas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203702;Vargas was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, into a family prominent in state politics. By 1922 he had risen rapidly in state politics and was elected to the National Congress, in which he served for four years. In 1926 Vargas became minister of finance in the Cabinet of President Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa, a post he retained until his election as governor of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From his position as state governor, Vargas campaigned unsuccessfully as reform candidate for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. While appearing to accept defeat, Vargas in October of that year led the revolution, organized by his friends, that overthrew the oligarchical republic. For the next 15 years Vargas assumed largely dictatorial powers, ruling most of that time without a congress. He held sole power as provisional president from Nov. 3, 1930, until July 17, 1934, when he was elected president by the constituent assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC188113;The Russians made a large landing at Tepsue soon after the Caucasian War restarted, intending to crush opposition in western Circassia after their successful occupation of eastern Circassia a decade earlier. Historically, the occupation was a reasonable success, yet casualties were very high on both sides and neither belligerent forgot the lessons learned during this conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188113;We will crush the Circassians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188113;We will do what is necessary and no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188114;Colonel Obshevski Gives A Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188114;Historically, soon after the conflict at Tepsue, Russian Colonel Obshevski gave a speech to the local Circassian population about the advantages of being under Russian control and the virtues of not rebelling against their Russian masters. The Circassians did not forget it, to the detriment of the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188114;Let the Circassians know who is boss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188114;Is this really necessary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188115;Imam Shamil Gains Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188115;Imam Shamil has gained power and become the Imam of the Caucasian Imamate! His frequent attacks against Russian outposts throughout the region are worrisome, and a decision is needed as to what to do with his resistance movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188115;Let us fight back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188115;Attempt to pull out of our weaker outposts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188116;United Circassian Offensive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188116;The Circassian resistance has managed to take out our minor outposts through sneak attacks, seizing supply depots, and what can be termed guerilla warfare. Although we have suffered much, our ready state of alertness prevented an overly large massacre of our people and has prevented our major outposts and fortresses from being overrun by the Circassians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188116;They will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188117;United Circassian Offensive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188117;Although we attempted to pull out of our weaker outposts, the Circassians have ambushed our travelling forces and seized our supplies. Our larger outposts relied on these smaller reinforcements to properly defend, and we have suffered some losses in our major military and civilian centers. This perceived weakness has given the Circassians free reign to massacre our people, and has shamed us on a world scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188117;An unfortunate event, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188118;Imam Shamil Offers a Truce;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188118;Imam Shamil has stated his demands regarding the Caucasus: independence, a return to the status quo of 1834, or death! Historically, the Imam and the Tsar agreed to a peace treaty, which was respected for almost a decade, as it worked out to both sides' advantage. The Russians had been humiliated at the Caucasus, but the Circassians could not hold out much longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188118;They will pay in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188118;Let them go, we have failed in the Caucasus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188119;Unrest in the Caucasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188119;There is increased unrest as of late, as Imam Shamil has begin a campaign of peaceful resistance and invective, wanting independence for his people and the Caucasus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188119;This has gone on too long. Send in the troops!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188119;Organize our forces but do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188120;Imam Shamil Stands Firm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188120;Imam Shamil has released an ultimatum: Caucasian independence or indefinite rebellion. His troops have already seized Russian supply depots and a few outposts, and as such he has dishonourably broken our treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188120;We will not stand this insolence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EBTOPTB188120;This is the last straw. Let them go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188121;Victories in the Caucasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188121;A string of military and civil victories in the Caucasus has led to the breaking of most Circassian resistance! Imam Shamil is on the run and the back of the resistance is broken! It seems that the war that has raged for almost a hundred years is almost over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188121;A great day for Russians everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188121;Let the rebel scum suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188122;Ethnic Cleansing of the Caucasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188122;Historically, soon after major victories in the Caucasus, the Russians purged the area of any undesireable elements. The ethnic cleansing continued until the 1870s, as many natives of the area were killed or deported to the Ottoman Empire. Indeed, the ethnic cleansing of the area has been considered by many historians to be the first ethnic cleansing on a modern scale and the harbinger of genocides as a concept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188122;We have fought for a hundred years. Let them suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188122;We need not descend into barbarism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188123;Imam Shamil Captured;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188123;Historically, Imam Shamil was captured in 1859. The Russians allowed him to live, albeit under surveillance in Kiev. The mutual respect that the Imam and the Tsar had for each other helped quite a bit in this aspect, and Imam Shamil saw the war as lost from this point. Although resistance continued in the Caucasus, the ideological center of the movement was removed, and the ideological foundation of the resistance foundered. Imam Shamil himself received permission from the Tsar to go on the Hajj to Mecca in 1869. He briefly stopped at Istanbul where he was greeted warmly by the Ottoman Sultan, but continued on his way to Mecca. He died shortly after completing the pilgrimage in 1871, a truly remarkable figure in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188123;Let him live free, but keep an eye on him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188123;Let him suffer the fate of all traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188124;The End of the Caucasian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188124;The last pockets of resistance have foundered, the rebellion is leaderless, tens of thousands lie dead, and the Circassian/Caucasian War has finally ended after 100 years of bloodshed. The people of the Caucasus now know their place in the Russian Empire, but such wars are not that easy to forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188124;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95671;The Non-German Territories;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95671;Now that we have fulfilled our destiny and united the German people under one banner, the question of our non-German lands remains. There is cries for independence, or at the very least, increased autonomy from $COUNTRY$. Refusing will no doubt greatly upset the other great powers as well as our population. Many voices in Government say that granting our non-German territories independence or even just extended autonomy is the best course of action in order to minimise damage to our reputation on the world stage as well as satisfying our population.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT180000DESC;Now that the war is over, the question arises whether or not we should allow the slaves we enlisted during the war to remain free, or send them back to work on the plantations. We made a promise to secure their freedom, but wars are a fickle thing, and some sacrifices have to be made for the betterment of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT181000DESC;With the dawn of the twentieth century, slavery in modern countries is fading away due to the prevalence of industry. A mere thirty years ago $COUNTRY_ADJ$ strength may have been founded on the backs of our slaves, but as tractors, automobiles, trains and other machines are making industry replace old mass labour, we have to make a distinct choice. Do we organize our slave economy, favouring it over industrial strength, or do we join the onward march of progress and free ourselves from the shackles that a slave society has forced us into? Just as fifty years ago a great house was divided, so now our $COUNTRY$ must become all one thing, or all the other: strong in the grip of slavery, or strong in the freedom of progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT183000DESC;The Confederate States of America are offering us our colony of Haiti, to be controlled by our government.

EVT185000DESC;Without a leader, the Atlantic Slave Trade cannot continue.

EVT186000DESC;Once we may have made slavery the centrepiece of our country, but those times have passed.

EVT187620DESC;Legendary showman (and scam artist) P.T. Barnum opened his first three-ring circus in 1871, beginning a circus craze that would last well into the 20th century.

EVT187630DESC;In order to improve the efficiency of railroads in our nation, we have adopted a system of standard time to prevent any confusion between train stations on the length of our railroad networks.

EVT187640DESC;Pioneered by men like Scott Joplin and Ernest Hogan, ragtime is a genre of music that began amongst African-Americans in the South. Afterwards, it became widely known and widely played on piano, and had a key role in popularizing new music recording methods and the later genre of jazz.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187650DESC;Blues music, like ragtime and jazz before it, was first played and composed by Afro-American musicians of the American South. While jazz enjoyed popularity amongst blacks and whites in the 1920s and 1930s, blues was mostly relegated to black listeners until after the Second World War. It was arguably formed as a musical genre in 1912 with the publishing of Hart Wand's "Dallas Blues", but has its roots in traditional slave songs of the 19th century. Most famously, blues later became the bedrock for the most popular musical sensation of them all: rock n' roll.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187660DESC;Though the North always was the industrial centre of America, in the Deep South there was the city of New Orleans, always full of sound and lights. The epitome of southern prosperity, New Orleans was a hub of trade and immigration, and at its peak was the third largest city in the entire United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187670DESC;The city of New Orleans always has had an association with the festival of Mardi Gras, a Christian cultural celebration taking place prior to the season of Lent brought to the area by French Catholic colonists. Normally it is meant to be just a single day of celebrations, but in New Orleans the colourful and energetic Mardi Gras can last for several days more. Mardi Gras was recognized as an official state holiday of Louisiana in 1875.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187680DESC;Politeness, etiquette, and the warm comforts of home: these define the ideal of Southern hospitality, and is a major characterizing point of our nation. People are expected to respect their neighbours and use polite terms even when addressing strangers. Some feel that this is an act put on to cover up Southern flaws such as slavery and widespread poverty, but its nature can be traced back to the traditional Christian moral influence on the Southern states before secession. Regardless, it's made a good mark on our country, and we're proud of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187690DESC;Founded in 1871, the National Rifle Association was originally a set of shooting clubs organized to improve the marksmanship of American soldiers. After the Civil War, it was noted that few shots fired actually hit their targets, so improved drill was in order. These shooting clubs improved skill with firearms, and contributed to the military as a whole moving away from the classic style of rank and file warfare, which put focus on volume of fire rather than accuracy. Within a few decades, firearms and marksmanship became a proud part of the country's culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT188000DESC;An infestation of boll weevils has struck our cotton crops in $PROVINCENAME$! Farmers are fearing that our supply of cotton won't last with this insect terrorizing our provinces, and many are suggesting that we abandon cotton to focus on different trade goods. Should we follow their advice, or try to recover the cotton?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT188100DESC;Rising up from the south, the boll weevil is a dreadful little insect that seems to have little interest in anything but planting its eggs in cotton flowers and buds. Regardless of its origins, it poses a major threat to our cotton industry, and must be stopped at all costs. For the time being, though, we fear that there may be no direct way of containing the insect, not on a large scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187700DESC;One hundred years ago, the Thirteen Colonies organized and succeeded in their rebellion against their British colonial oppressors, forming the United States of America on the 4th of July, 1776. We have seen this country through fire and water, but by God, we will never let America fall. Now unto the end of time, the United States will be a shining name in the pages of history, a beacon of freedom and democracy in the world. Today of all days, we truly should be proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187710DESC;Travelling along the western trails into California, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ wagon group known as the Donner party has been discovered... or, at least, what is left of it. The people of the Donner party were stranded in the wilderness for so long that their minds were lost, and they succumbed to cannibalism and other savage acts.

EVT187720DESC;Due to recent heavy rainfall and the negligence of a local construction company, a dam on the Little Conemaugh River has burst, flooding and decimating Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The cleanup costs will be higher than any disaster we've seen before, and more importantly, the people will soon be looking for someone to place the blame upon. The government could step in and take care of everything in place of the local industrialists and clubs that may have caused the flood, or we can require that the groups pay from their own pockets to fix their mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187730DESC;Though our war with the Confederate States is far from over, it isn't going either poorly or well. However, that doesn't stop the war from being a contentious issue, and in New York most notably the people have staged an uprising against the local government, demanding that the strict conscription practices in place for the war be rescinded. We're in the middle of a war, so we have to choose some way to deal with them, without sacrificing our draft. The question is, are these riots worth putting down, or are our other concerns far greater?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187740DESC;James Madison, fourth president of the United States of America and the man titled "The Father of the Constitution", was a key figure in the founding of our nation. On June 28th, 1836, he passed away - much to the chagrin of those close to him, who wished for him to follow the "tradition" of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, who both died on Independence Day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187750DESC;The Gulf of Mexico is no stranger to extreme wind and rain, but in 1900, a certain hurricane blew away any old records. The storm decimated Galveston, Texas, and reached the Canadian Maritimes before dissipating completely.

EVT187760DESC;A man going by the name of Doctor Howard Henry Holmes has been apprehended and executed after murdering up to two-hundred people after the last $COUNTRY_ADJ$ World's Fair. According to police reports, he built up a so-called "Murder Castle" in $CAPITAL$, killing primarily young women that he lured to his lair. Using legitimate medical contacts he was able to dispose of the bodies, and for a long time he remained far out of suspicion. Only after leaving the city due to economic troubles did Holmes end up being captured, as a result of alleged horse theft. Afterwards the truth of his grisly crimes came to light, and he was sentenced to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MISSFLOOD1DESC;Along the Missouri River and the Upper Mississippi, heavy rainfall and inadequate preparation have led to major floods, the worst in decades. With the increasing population of $COUNTRY$ especially in the areas around the Mississippi and its tributaries, it is becoming increasingly important to develop a set of levees and ditches to prevent high water from wiping out whole towns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MISSFLOOD2DESC;Not long after last decade's horrendous floods along the Upper Mississippi, there has been another year of rain and subsequent floods along the very same Mississippi River. We had prepared and made sure riverside towns were prepared for any threat of flooding, but this time the floods hit mostly rural and new colonial towns, which hadn't yet managed to create systems of levees to cope with rising water levels.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MISSFLOOD3DESC;The worst floods yet have hit many of our cities, no matter how high we built the levees nor how low and long we dug the ditches. New Orleans, shining gem of Louisiana, has been dealt a heavy blow, along with cities and regions all along the mighty Mississippi River.

EVTDESC187890;There are a growing number of Freemasons within Brazilian churches, which is nominally prohibited in Catholicism - they exist most commonly within Lay Fraternities, which are generally charitable organizations chiefly associated with local churches, though technically independent in their operation. Historically, however, the church in Brazil has been an apparatus of the state, rather than being independent, thus making religious issues in Brazil matters of the state, not the Catholic Church. Local bishops have been calling for Freemason clergymen to resign, including a man named Dom Vital, who has issued an interdict against certain Lay Fraternities that have refused to have their Freemason brothers resign, preventing any sacraments from being celebrated within these Fraternity buildings. This goes against the state control of the Church, so the Lay brothers say, and is a direct challenge to government power considering that certain members of Parliament are noted Freemasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187892;Dom Vidal has refused to annul his controversial interdict, and has been joined in protest by the bishop Antonio de Macedo Costa, who has recently passed a similar interdict against uncooperative Lay Fraternities.

EVTDESC187894;Vidal and Costa have been imprisoned for acting against the power of the sovereign Brazilian state, causing shock and anger amongst the Catholic populace in the country.

EVTDESC187910;Inspired by the liberal revolutions in Europe, a party of Liberals in Brazil, calling themselves the Praieiros, has begun stirring up tensions in our country.

EVTDESC187914;The young Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, is yet too young to rule the country, due to his father abdicating in 1831 in order to restore his daughter Maria to her rightful throne of Portugal.

EVTDESC187915;After much debate, it has been decided that Pedro II, though still under the age of majority, will reign without a regency. He has proven to be a very capable young man, though he is quite shy, and he is much beloved by the people. Due to the poor rulership of the regency, it will be immediately terminated, and Dom Pedro II will officially begin his reign as Emperor of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187916;Dom Pedro II, the Magnanimous, has passed away this morning. The people of Brazil loved him until the very end, and his impeccable rulership brought a true golden age to the Empire of Brazil. Working towards the cause of abolition and civil freedom, Dom Pedro made many influential friends, with his various associates, from Friedrich Nietzsche and Alexander Graham Bell to Victor Hugo and Charles Darwin. An intellectual and a devoted emperor, in his later years he found himself disappointed with the role of a ruler, so perhaps with his passing he has achieved the happiness that eluded him all his life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187917;The imperial administration of Dom Pedro II has, with the recent coup and overthrow of the government, been reduced to dust. The emperor has officially and willingly abdicated the throne, and has not tried to retake it or resist the end of the Empire. Government of the country is being transferred to a council of able governors, and the royal family of Brazil and Portugal are hereby exiled from this country for ever more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187925;A free man of black ancestry has given a speech at a national university.

EVTDESC187926;Capitalists have formed what they call a "Progressive Society" in $PROVINCENAME$, hoping to bring an end to slavery.

EVTDESC187930;In the plantation fields of $PROVINCENAME$, the sound of "The Internationale" can be heard more loudly and frequently than old slave songs.

Arguments could be made against them that they are sabotaging the economy, but in a free economy, they have the right to employ whomever they choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187940;Two Confederate diplomats, hoping to establish good relations with our country, are aboard the HMS Trent.

EVTDESC187942;We have received word that the British, after their HMS Trent was commandeered by a Union captain on the USS San Jacinto. The Trent is carrying two Confederate diplomats, en route to Britain and France, no doubt in order to coerce them into joining the war. The British are demanding an apology from our officials and the immediate release of the diplomats, and have been making isolated showings of force along the Canadian border.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187943;Delegates from the United States have apologized and released the two Confederate envoys into British care. They made several demonstrations that they would not interfere with British shipping in any way in the future, and our own officials came back quite pleased with the meeting. Of course, at this point we certainly cannot join the Confederates, or offer them any support, in light of tense Anglo-American relations as a result of the Trent affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187944;The United States has begun to position troops along its border with our colony in Canada, making it clear that they will not back down. Official delegates from the United States government declare that what they did was only an act of war against the Confederates, but if British diplomats press the Trent issue, then the Union will consider Britain on the side of the Confederate secessionists, and react accordingly. It seems that there is no choice now but war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187918;In the Brazilian navy, the use of the dreaded lash to discipline soldiers has been officially banned for several years. However, many white officers still use it to keep their typically black, sometimes even ex-slave crews in line, causing accusations of institutionalized discrimination in the military. Several all-black crews have recently revolted against their officers, taken control of their ships, and are in port outside $CAPITAL$, threatening to bombard the city. They are demanding amnesty and reparations, and an end to discrimination, a promise we may not be able to completely deliver.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187919;Though the Atlantic slave trade has been dismantled by the British, many traders in Brazil have found ways to smuggle slaves into our country.

EVTDESC187923;Being a constitutional monarch, our Emperor Dom Pedro II has quite a lot of time to travel the world and meet the many personalities therein.

Congress could make and interpret the laws, but only the President could order that they be promulgated and enforced. The constitution placed no restrictions on the powers of the president, beyond limiting his term of office to ten years. The constitution also included no guarantee of civil rights.

Hermogen, who told Rasputin to stay away from the palace, repeated the rumours that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a sect. Iliodor, hinting that Rasputin was Alexandra's paramour, showed Makarov a satchel of letters. The letters were handed to the Tzar and Rodzianko requested Rasputin to leave the capital. When Kokovtsov became prime minister he asked the Tzar permission to authorize Rasputin's exile to Tobolsk, but Nicholas refused: "I know Rasputin too well to believe all the tittle-tattle about him."

In $YEAR$, Tzar Nicholas took supreme command of the Russian armies, leaving his wife in charge of ruling the country. Alexandra loathed the Duma because of its discussion of Rasputin.

Purishkevich boasted he had shot Rasputin, and asked the policeman, aware of his mistake, to keep it quiet for the sake of the Tsar. Rasputin's beaver-fur coat and the body were discovered in a frozen river, 140 meters away from the Bolshoy Petrovsky bridge, with a shot in his frontal lobe. The two nobles who killed Rasputin were exiled by the Tzar, who came back from the front. Progressively, more and more people came to the conclusion that the problem was not Rasputin but the weak-willed Emperor, who had secluded himself in Tsarskoye Selo, unable to react on what happened.

But his hypnotic eyes couldn't do anything against the bullet of one of the members of the Communist Party who believed he could destabilize the government by killing a close friend of the Tzar's family and the Tzarina most trusted advisor. The Russian nobility rejoiced at the death of Rasputin, assassinated as he left his home, but the death had the inverse effect that his assassin expected: the Russian Tzar left his isolation and ordered a hunt. The police organized a crackdown in every syndicate or communist party/organization, severely crippling communist support and organization, and rounding up a few suspects including a prominent figure in the communist circles, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In early May 1908 D'Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000 pounds into his Persian venture and found no oil, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to "cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home."

EVTDESC900022;A twenty four years old merchant from Shiraz, called Siyyid 'Alí Muhammad Shírází, on May 22, 1844, claimed to be an inspired interpreter of the Qur'an within the Shaykhi school of Twelver Shi'ism. Within five months, eighteen disciples of the Skaykhi school had independently recognized him as a Manifestation of God. These eighteen disciples were later known as the Letters of the Living. In his early writings, Siyyid appears to identify himself as the gate (báb) to the Hidden Twelfth Imam and later he begins to explicitly proclaim his station as that of the Hidden Imam and a new messenger from God. After some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy, prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb's arrest. The Báb, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in $YEAR$ and presented himself to the authorities.

Both were taken to the courtyard of the barracks the next day where thousands of people had gathered to watch the execution. They were suspended on a wall in front of a large squad of Christian soldiers, the order was given to fire and the courtyard was filled with musket smoke. When it cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and Anís was unharmed: the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the ropes. There was a great commotion, many in the crowd believing the Báb had ascended to heaven or simply disappeared. The Báb was subsequently found in another part of the barracks, completely unharmed, giving his final instructions to his secretary.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As we can't get access to the exotic places of this world, a commission has proposed to gain experience in a local excavation. If we have an organized and professional troop of archaeologists, we may have more chances in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201017;Local Excavation;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201017;It seems, that after years of practising and studying, our scientists have found an interesting place, which was mostly neglected in the past. After weeks of work, we have managed to find old tombs of a prehistoric times. Our archaeologists have gained experience and are looking forward. It seems, that we have started our own archaeological project.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201018;Archaeological Society;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201018;Modern science is on the rise. $COUNTRY$, a high regarded nation of historians, philologues and archaeologists, is well-known for its researches. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Archaeological Institute was founded today as an association of these groups to make our efforts even more effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201019;A Famous Archaeologist;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201019;A member of our Archaeological society has become a leading expert with worldwide reputation and many successful excavations all around the world. He introduced new methods and wrote a guide for future generations. He is seen as the most talented man in this field, and $COUNTRY$ is proud of his famous son.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201021;An Old Stele;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201021;Deep in the jungle, our archaeologists have found an old stele of the classical period. This artefact is not only a wonderful piece of art, but will give us new insight in the ancient world of the Mayas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201022;Mysterious Maya Pyramid;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201022;Haze lays above the forests and hills of Yucatan. The mist clears up, as our expedition keeps going through the wild and awkward jungle. Jaguars and other ferocious beasts are living in this unspoiled nature. Savages has hunted a group of our team and injured many. They were doomed. Others were infected by Malaria, victims of the feared and bloodthirsty Mosquitos. Only a little grouplet of three persons has survived the exertions. The leader, a man with three-day stubble and a bull-whip in his hand, gives a sign to rest for a while. Steles and rocks with engravings. The whole territory is marked by them. The archaeologist's eyes flit over stairs, destroyed and mossy. The ancient ruin of a Maya pyramid. He pricks up his ears, as one of the heavers raises his hand and shouts: "Hombre, I think I found the entrance!";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201023;Our expedition has found an ancient Maya Pyramid in the middle of the jungle of Yucatan. And even more, our chief-archaeologist, René Emile Belloq, was able to get a holy idol, which was coincidentally in the hand of a fedora-wearing american archaeologist. Unfortunately, this poor man was slained by savages of the local Hovito tribe, as Belloq affirms. Now, this wonderful idol will be our new tourist attraction in the Mesoamerican section of the Louvre!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201025;Expedition Members Eaten by Dinosaurs?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201025;The members of our last expedition in the unexplored jungles of Yucatan have returned without success. The survivors, emaciated, pale and littered with scars, have lost even their equipment and are happy that they were able to return. But the director of the Archaeological Museum rose his eyebrows, when they were forced to tell, what happened to the other team members, the heavers and the equipment. The leading archaeologists shouted like a maniac, made wild gesticulations and told, that they were lost in a hidden valley, in the middle of the jungle, unknown to anyone. In this valley, prehistoric animals like dinosaurs and other extinct creatures lived and attacked the expedition. He continued his fantastic story, becoming even more exaggerated, and was finally brought in a sanatory. We don't know what happened, but this man has clearly lost his mind. Now we must start from the scratch. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201026;El Mirador Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201026;Ruins in the jungle as far as the eye can reach. These remains are old - very old, as our archaeologists affirm. This huge city is one of the biggest places ever found in Yucatan, and it dates back to pre-classical times. El Mirador, one of the oldest and greatest settlements of the Mayan culture, was rediscovered by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201027;A Mayan Riddle;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201027;Footsteps resound in the hall. Light is rare, only a torch illuminates engraved walls. Silence. You go farther, through a corridor. Observing the plates on the ground, the roots of enormous trees, which break through the collapsed ceiling. An amazing place. You take a breath. A breath of history, which floatens this atmosphere. Then, after minutes of walking through mossy corridors, you find a monumental gate, decorated with faces and hieroglyphs. A short view in your book later, you are able to read what the Mayas wrote centuries ago on this wall. It's a riddle: "The farmer needs it/ the capitalist loves it/ and builds even factories/ but you hate it./ If you stockpile the/ most useless good in/ the world you will/ uncover the truth.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201028;The Idol;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201028;You fetch your bag with fertilizer. (Every $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist has his bag with fertilizer with him, as everyone knows, because of the famous $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fertilizer Decree, which enforces every archaeologist to take a bag of fertilizer with him, because nobody in the world wants to buy it and $COUNTRY$ searches ways to get rid of it.) In front of you stands an altar. Gold sparkles in the glimming light. An Mayan idol. A sceptical look to it. A look to the bag. You weigh the bag in your hand, estimating the weight of the idol. Fertilizer runs out of the bag. It is now lightier. You are waiting for the moment, staring at the idol, the bag with fertilizer in the left hand, your right hand on the head of the artefact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201029;It's a Trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201029;You are able to replace the idol. The bag of fertilizer lays on the altar. You look in the face of the strange idol, enjoying the beauty of Mayan art. Savouring this moment, only for a little while. Noises. Brutal, loud noises interrupt the scene. You look upward. Something has changed. The muffled noise becomes louder. Something is rolling. Something big. Very big. A gigantic stoneball!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201030;You escape through the corridors, the idol in your right hand, but the trap is triggered. A gigantic stoneball is rolling right behind you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201031;An Evil Frenchman;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201031;With a last jump you are able to reach the exit of the pyramid, landing in the grass of the jungle - and cornered by mesoamerican Indios. A voice with a soft french accent sounds in the near. A man in white clothes looks at you, amused by your escape. "It is nice to meet you. But I think, this artefact should be in better hands than yours." You are forced to surrender, as the heavers were killed by the tribe. "Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do" is your only response. Your are able to flee - but without the idol.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201032;Leaving the Pyramid;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201032;On your way out of the pyramid, you clatch at a root in the ceiling. The idol in the left, the root in the right, the stoneball rolls under your shoes, through the corridor, and crushs in the jungle. You slump down, following the devastation. As you reach the exit, you see smashed bodies of Indios, scattered spears and weapons. It seems, that someone prepared an ambush, which was dissolved by the huge ball. Not sure, what happened here, but now, that the expedition was a full success, it is time to return to $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201033;An Archive of Cuneiform Tablets;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201033;Clay tablets were used as writing medium in the ancient middle east. Imprinted cuneiform characters can give us a whole new viewing of the old times of Babylonia. Satisfyingly, our archaeologists have found a whole archive of old tablets on their last expedition. They believe, that this archive was part of a large palace of an unknown ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201034;Sumerian Palace Found;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201034;Today is an exceptional day for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology. After months of researchs and excavations, our team has found an old palace, dating back to sumerian times. Our archaeologists estimate, that this structures are over 5000 years old!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201035;Mesopotamian Expedition Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201035;The archaeological team in Mesopotamia is in a bad crisis. It seems, that the place of research was miscalculated by the chief-archaeologists. In fact, they have searched for month at the false place, finding nothing and remaining only with dirt in their hands. That is a heavy setback for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201036;The Tower of Babel;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201036;Scientific research and aerial photos leave no doubt: Babylon, once a myth and known in the west only as a decadent city mentioned in the Bible, is now a well known place of modern archaeology. The Hanging Gardens of Semiramis and a large palace were found and carefully examined. Archivs full of clay tablets were translated. But the most prestigious trove was the discovery by an $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist, who confirmed that even the legendary Tower of Babel is not a fable, but has historical roots. A large building was found, believed as the example for the story in the Bible. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201040;Preparations;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201040;The Andes are rough and dangerous. Our archaeologists should be well equipped before we send them in the mountains. A list of goods was made, which the expedition demands. We should prepare 1 airplane, 1 off-road vehicle, 2 units of canned food and 3 barrels of fuel.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201041;The Expedition Begins;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201041;The Peruvian sun scorches our skin. We have left Cusco one week ago, entering the endless lands of mountains. The majesty of the Andes is overwhelming, and the ravines deep like the gorges of hell. Henry, my fellow student from twenty years ago, has joined this journey to undiscovered lands. His nose and eyes are deepened in a book. "So, this was the way they took?", he asks en passant. "No wonder they got lost." My only response is a nod. Henry is an experienced archaeologist, a high regarded personality. Unlike me, he was able to climb the career ladder. They say, that he would be able to find Alexander's tomb in a second, only wandering in it's near - when others dug for centuries, only excavating some old chicken bones. "The aeroplane is ready", I mention, wiping the sweat from my eyebrows. It's the moment, when Henry puts his book away. "Aeroplane?", sounds his voice sceptically, "I don't like them. You know, I get sick in these darn machines. What about the car the government offered us?";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201042;An Old Bridge;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201042;I follow Henry's advice. I'm the official leader of this expedition, but I know Henry's aversion against these new technologies. When we began with our studies at the university, our professors put us for days in dirty holes, only equipped with a rusty shovel and outdated instruments. Now, everything has changed. The methods, the equipment. Even a car. "That's a fine kind of travelling", Henry says, leaning in the cushioned seat beside me, viewing the panorama. Maybe I must correct myself - some technologies seem to please even Henry. But than, we are forced to make a stop. A river cuts the hills in front of us, and only an old bridge connects both sides. It is obvious that we can't go on the other side with our vehicle. The bridge seems in a bad condition, only made of ragged ropes. I look in Henry's direction. "And now? What shall we do?";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201043;Crossing the Bridge;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201043;The ropes make noises, as we have decided to left the car behind and cross the bridge. We have shouldered our equipment. We make one step after another, looking only forward. The noises become louder. "Maybe that was not the the best idea", I suggest. Henry doesn't give an answer. His hands are trembling. His hands staring to the ropes. "The ropes! The ropes are ripping - go back, before the whole bridge collapses!" But his warnings are to late. It seems, that we have overloaded the old bridge, tearing the ropes in pieces. Yelling and cryings later, clutching the salvaging ropes with both hands, we dangle above the abyss, seeing our equipment falling in the depth of Andean valleys. We are save, hanging at the clip, but lost our equipment. An idea comes to our mind: this bridge was an Incan trap. And without our provisions we are forced to give up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201044;Lost in the Mountains;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201044;Taking the vehicle wasn't the best thing we could do. Now, that we have been for days in the Andes, we realize that the steep and inhospitable mountains are not made for such a technology. There are no more streets we can take, and we are running out of fuel. Even our provisions are used up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201045;Peruvian Sky;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201045;It was not easy to persuade Henry, but after hours of discussion he indulges. We take the 'Atalanta', an aircraft which the government provided us. After the take-off, Henry takes his diary, searching the bookmark in it. "Manco Capac", he notes. "The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state is searching for his remains? I didn't know that there are such optimists in the government." His voice has turned in a sarcastical mood. Henry searched the last five years for a sign of the legends associated with Manco Capac. Manco Capac, the last glorious King of the Incas. He fought the Spanish in a rebellion. He moved from Cusco to Vilcabamba and made the latter city his new capital. The last capital of the free Incan people. The discovery of Machu Picchu made many archaeologists believe, that there could be more historical sides nearby. "You should fly lower", Henry proposed, "we can't see anything." "But there is fog, and the mountains are clouded. It is too risky", I reply. But Henry is not convinced: "And what happens, if we overlook something?";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201046;The Crash;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201046;Wreckages lay lounge around. The smell of fire comes from the motor. The aeroplane is battered, pieces of metal gleam in the Andean sun. I can rescue my colleague out of the wreck. Henry is unconscious, but alive. My manouver was a bit too confident, I wasn't able to see the rough cliffs in the clouds. Our journey is over, as I decide to return to Cusco.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201047;A Temple? A Temple!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201047;We have won hight. The scenery becomes miniature. Henry, who was at first against this decision, suddenly seems interested. "Did you see that?" "What?" "I bet I saw a temple! Look! There! I'm sure, on this plateau", he points with his finger on the window. A temple! Henry was right. It was buried by the mountains, but here in the sky, from above, it is clearly to see. "We must land!", Henry becomes excited. "Immediately!" I see the look in his face. He is a rational and cold mind, but when it comes to an archaeological discovery, Henry changes. It seems, that he can smell this type of things. But I can't share his opinion. The plateau is not the best field to land. It is not very large, and it would cost me a lot of courage to do this bold step.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201048;Temple Lost Out of Sight;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201048;I searched for a better place to land, but when I found it, it was nearly impossible to find the place where the temple was. I made a second round to rediscover the Incan monument, but it was without success. Henry made his own expedition by foot, which resulted in failure. After weeks of useless search, we gave up hope to find the temple again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201049;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201049;I was able to land 'Atalanta', despite my concerns. The aeroplane landed softly on the plateau, and Henry jumped out of the machine when the airscrew were still moving. I follow him, looking up to the temple which is in a surprising good condition. Too untouched to be true. "On my voyages in Peru, I never saw a Incan temple in such a good shape", Henry mentions. "That is an extraordinary discovery. The archaeologists at home would be astonished." I go forward, Henry waits instead, putting his hand on the stone. He observes the strange engravings. "Any information?", I ask, but he denies. "That seems to be a very strange place. I can't interpret this figures. It's a shame that the Incas have no writing or hieroglyphs as the Mayas do, so everything remains obscure.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201050;Breakfast with Llamas;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201050;"Manco Capac, eh? You two are searching for the remains of the famous last Incan ruler? Follow me!" A native offered his service. Now we travel through the Peruvian mountains, our equipment and ourself carried by llamas. Henry is convinced, that a voyage with this creature, which were domisticated to reach even the most inhospitable areas of the Andes, will be more useful than the new technologies. But when I turned to him, I saw his grim face. "Henry, what is the matter?" "I don't trust this man", Henry answers. "It would be better if we buy the llamas and leave him instead. For me, he knows too much.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201051;Weren't We Here Once Before?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201051;Days and weeks go by. It took this long time after I realized, that Henry was right with his assumption. This llama leader wanted to trick us. Unfortunately, it was to late. When we wanted to confront him, he escaped with the llamas. It took us days before we were able to return to Cusco, exhausted and without equipment or success.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201052;Through the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201052;Without a leader, we are shift for ourself. The journey continues, but the problem of disorientation becomes obvious. Henry spent five years to examine Incan culture, chasing every evidence regarding the legendary capital of Manco Capac, Vilcabamba. But this area is unknown to him. Wandering through this inhabitated landscape drives us to despair. No ruins. No Incan remains. Nothing. Which direction should we take?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201053;Lost in the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201053;The blue heaven. The golden sun. Grey stones and mountains. Nothing has sense. We don't find the way to a promising archaeological place. We don't even find back home. The Andes are our grave, and maybe one day we will be found by other archaeologists, in thousands of years, making a good sample for an exhibition...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201054;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201054;The sunset brightens the sky in red colours, shining on stones. Stones of a building. On the top of a plateau, an old temple sits enthroned like an Incan god-king above the Andes. I tether the llamas, but Henry keeps going forward. "On my voyages in Peru, I never saw a Incan temple in such a good shape", he mentions. "That is an extraordinary discovery. The archaeologists at home would be astonished." I go forward, Henry waits instead, putting his hand on the stone. He observes the strange engravings. "Any information?", I ask, but he denies. "That seems to be a very strange place. I can't interpret this figures. It's a shame that the Incas have no writing or hieroglyphs as the Mayas do, so everything remains obscure.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201055;War Interrupts Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201055;The communication between our expedition in Peru and our archaeological society is interupted. Until the war goes on, our enemies will try to disturb every information exchange.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201056;Expedition in Peru Responds Again;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201056;Immedietly after the end of the war, the expedition in Peru has contacted us again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201037;Tutankhamun's Tomb Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201037;The discovery of this archaeological sensation is an international event. What should we do now, regarding the Great powers?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201038;El Mirador Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201039;The Tower of Babel Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201058;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201058;We searched for hours, but we didn't find the entrance. A huge portal marks an area, which we identify as a possible gate, but it it is closed by a huge stone slab. Knots of alpaca hair is hanging above us, corded in strange knots. "A quipu! At least something." Henry seems facilitated. The Incas wrote their messages in a complicated systems of knots, why we call them also "talking knots". Henry is able to decipher it, but his look is confused. "But... that can be true. The most quipus were conserved in the coast regions. In the mountains, nearly 90% are rotten." "Henry, please, continue the translation", I interrupt. "We have later time for these investigations." Henry grumbles, cathces a breath. Than he proceeds: "Sacrifice the flesh of an animal/ the flesh of a tree/ the flesh of the sea/ and the flesh of the earth./ Finally, after five pounds of llama wool/ you will see Intis sun.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201059;The Labyrinth;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201059;We gathered the asked goods. The are forced to give up our provisions, and I sacrifice my golden pocket watch, to fullfill the "flesh of a god" part. Lastly, we lay the llama pelts, which we took with us - fearing the cold of the night in the Andes - to the other pieces of the sacrifice, in front of the slab. "That is ridiculous", Henry delivers. "What comes next? Will Inti step down from the sky and open the door?" "Do you have a better idea?" "Maybe not a better one, but at least not so dumb like this unscientific proposal!" I want to respond, but the sound of a shattering rock breaks in. The ground trembles, shakes, and rips. The food and the wool vanish in a dark hole, together with dust and gravel. After a moment of shoke, we decide to climb down. Henry takes his rope, and after a while, we abseil in the darkness. The spark of a torch later, we stare at corridors, stairs, different floors and bizarre constructions. I never saw such an amazing compilation of dizziyng architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201060;Donwstairs;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201060;After a hard downfall, we realize, that we are cought in a pit. I grab the torch, fire is enlightning the environment again. "Henry?" "Yes?" "Why is the ground moving?" Silence follows. I lower the torch - we are surrounded by snakes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201061;Upstairs;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201061;We reach a higher level, following a passage through a tunnel. "Something seems similar", I notice. "What?", Henry asks - following a strange sound, like a switch, which is now activated...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201062;It's a Trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201062;"AHHHHHH!" Our screams echoes in the labyrinth, followed by the sound of the gigantic stoneball behind us. At least, we are able to escape in a save corridor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201063;The Corridor;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201063;Reconsidering our situation, taking the corridor was a bold step. Everything seems confusing, and when we go upstairs, it seems that we go downstairs. Each step could be a trap. And there are many different routes we can chose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201064;Lost in the Temple;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201064;Right. Left. Left. Right. Upstairs. Downstairs. Deadlock. Return. Right. Upstairs. Deadlock. Return. Return. Left. Right. Corridors, scales, floors - everywhere. I give up. We are completly lost in this strange place. There is no exit, no way out!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201065;The Sanctuary;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201065;A wide hall. Symbols and scenes decorate the walls. It seems, that we have left the labyrinth. We look up, to the ceiling, higher than 20 feet. Snakes, made of stone, surround a portal on the other side. He sits on a bench, a plate on his thighs - the food on it, which we "sacrified". He is skinny and old. He notices us, but doesn't react. While he is eating, we come nearer. "Im sure, that behind this portal, there is something very imporant", I say to Henry. "Clearly. An old, skinny man is guarding it. Every important chambered is guarded ba an old, skinny, mysterious. Hell, he lacks only a long white beard and a crusader-sword!" Henry can become very sarcastic in such situation. "And he is eating our provision!" "Please, please... don't be so loud, my ears", quits the old man his meal. "If you calm down, I'm willing to answer your questions. This is the Temple of the Sun. A holy place. And I'm the guard of the heritage of our progenitors.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201066;The Decision;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201066;"It's the duty of my family to protect this place", he begins. "Since generations, one man in one generation takes it on. The people from the near villages come to this sanctuary, bringing food and clothes, so I can concentrade on my service. But, times are changing. And I can't protect a culture which will die. The young people in the Andes are not interested in our past or our religion." He stands up, nodding, than he looks to us. "I know what you want. But do you really know what you want?" "Oh that is such a cliché. An old mysterious man is protecting an ancient place, all his life, and then, when - casually - two archaeologists come around, he spends time on philosphical phrases..." "Henry!" "It is true!", my colleague underlines. The old man grins. "Anyway", he begins, "what are you going to do?";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201067;Temple of the Sun Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201067;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ has found the Temple of the Sun, a magnificent testimony of Incan art, build under the rule of the last great Inca, Manco Capac II. Wonderful and precious artfeacts were found and brought to the National Museum.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201068;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ has found the Temple of the Sun, a magnificent testimony of Incan art, build under the rule of the last great Inca, Manco Capac II. A restricted archaeological area was arranged to prevent other people from this place. The scientists expect new and interesting informations regarding the life of the Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201069;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ has found the Temple of the Sun, a magnificent testimony of Incan art, build under the rule of the last great Inca, Manco Capac II.

EVTNAME202009;Giuseppe Mazzini;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202009;Giuseppe Mazzini, was an Italian politician, journalist and activist for the unification of Italy. Mazzini was a member of the Carbonari, a secret association with political purposes. Later, he went to Marseille, where he became a popular figure to the other Italian exiles. He organized a new political society called La giovine Italia (Young Italy). It was a secret society formed to promote Italian unification. Mazzini believed that a popular uprising would create a unified Italy, and would touch off a European-wide revolutionary movement. Young Italy counted ca 60,000 adherents in 1833, with branches in Genoa and other cities. In that year Mazzini launched a first attempt of insurrection in Sardinia, which failed.  He organized another uprising for the following year.

EVTDESC202011;Giuseppe Mazzini, was an Italian politician, journalist and activist for the unification of Italy. Mazzini was a member of the Carbonari, a secret association with political purposes. Later, he went to Marseille, where he became a popular figure to the other Italian exiles. He organized a new political society called La giovine Italia (Young Italy). It was a secret society formed to promote Italian unification. Mazzini believed that a popular uprising would create a unified Italy, and would touch off a European-wide revolutionary movement. Young Italy counted ca 60,000 adherents in 1833, with branches in Genoa and other cities. In that year Mazzini launched a first attempt of insurrection in Sardinia, which failed.  He organized another uprising for the following year. A group of Italian exiles were to enter Piedmont from Switzerland and spread the revolution there, and founded a new association with German and Polish refugees, called Young Europe. Austria and Sardinia put pressure on Switzerland to extradite him, but Mazzini was able to escape, and moved to London.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC202014;The conclave of 1846, following the death of Pope Gregory XVI (183146), took place in an unsettled political climate within Italy. Because of this, many foreign Cardinals decided not to attend the conclave. At its start, only 46 out of 62 cardinals were present. Moreover, the conclave of 1846 was steeped in a factional division between conservatives and liberals. Faced with deadlock, liberals and moderates decided to cast their votes for Mastai-Ferretti in a move that contradicted the general mood throughout Europe. By the second day of the conclave, on 16 June 1846, during an evening ballot, Mastai-Ferretti was elected Pope.  As liberal Europe applauded his election, he introduced political reforms on a broad scale. For the next twenty months after the election, Pius IX was the most popular man on the Italian peninsula, where the exclamation "Long life to Pius IX!" was often heard. His initial policies created quite a sensation among Italian patriots, both at home and in exile.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202033;I Promessi Sposi;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202033;The Betrothed (orig. Italian: I Promessi Sposi) is an Italian historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni, first published in 1827, in three volumes. Set in Northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years under Spanish rule, it is sometimes seen as a veiled attack on Austria, which controlled the region at the time the novel was written. I Promessi Sposi was the first Italian historical novel,  a model for subsequent Italian literary fiction and a basis for the modern Italian language. In the early 19th century, there was still some controversy as to what form the standard literary language of Italy should take. Manzoni - originally from Milan - was firmly in favour of the dialect of Florence and, after "washing his vocabulary on the banks of the Arno" (as he put it), he revised the novel's language for its republication in 1842. Many expressions, quotes and names from the novel are still commonly used in Italian, such as Perpetua or "Questo matrimonio non s'ha da fare" and it is still considered a true masterpiece of world literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202035;Il Canto degli Italiani;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202035;Il Canto degli Italiani (The Song of the Italians) is best known among Italians as 'Inno di Mameli' (Mameli's Hymn), after the author of the lyrics, or 'Fratelli d'Italia' (Brothers of Italy), from its opening line. The words were written in $YEAR$ in Genoa, by the then 20-year-old student and patriot Goffredo Mameli, in a climate of popular struggle for unification and independence of Italy which foreshadowed the war against Austria. The hymn enjoyed widespread popularity throughout the period of the Risorgimento and in the following decades. The hymn was also printed on leaflets in Genoa, by the printing office Casamara and published on the December 10: the demonstration was officially dedicated to the 101st anniversary of the expulsion of the Austrian powers from the city - in fact it was an excuse to protest against foreign occupations in Italy and induce Carlo Alberto to embrace the Italian cause of liberty. In this occasion the tricolor flag was shown and Mameli's hymn was publicly sung for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202038;The Legacy of Ugo Foscolo;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202038;When Italy conquered Rome, the new nation state antagonized the Papacy and was in a permament struggle with the Apostolic See. Italy favored secular movements and a new national spirit to encounter the strong catholic sentiment within the country, emulating the french state. Italian artists, philosophers or scientists were promoted, and Santa Croce in Florence became an equivalent to the Pantheon in Paris. Especially personalities with secular or atheistic views were important, like the famous italian revolutionary and poet Ugo Foscolo. Foscolo, born on Zakynthos (the venetian Zante) in 1778 was an important figure in this new gallery of "Secular Saints", but unfortunately, Foscolo died in Chiswick, Western London, after eleven years of exile in England. In $YEAR$, Italy requested his remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME202042;First wireless transatlantic transmission;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202042;At the turn of the 20th century, the italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began investigating the means to signal completely across the Atlantic, in order to compete with the transatlantic telegraph cables. Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, Co. Wexford in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu in Cornwall and Clifden in Co. Galway. He soon made the announcement that on 12 December 1901, using a 152.4-metre (500 ft) kite-supported antenna for reception, the message was received at Signal Hill in St John's, Newfoundland (now part of Canada) signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall. In $YEAR$, Marconi built a station near South Wellfleet, Massachusetts that sent a message of greetings from Theodore Roosevelt, the President of the United States, to King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission originating in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202046;Macchi M.C.72;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202046;The Macchi M.C. 72 was an experimental seaplane designed and built by the Italian aircraft company Macchi Aeronautica. The M.C. 72 was built in 1931 with the idea of competing for what turned out to be the final Schneider Trophy race, but due to engine problems, the M.C. 72 was unable to compete. For two years, the M.C. 72 suffered from many mechanical defects, as well as the loss of two test pilots who died trying to coax world class speed out of the M.C. 72. The aircraft finally lived up to expectations when it set a new world speed record on 10 April 1933, with a speed of 682 km/h. Not satisfied, development continued as the aircraft's designers thought they could break 700 km/h with the M.C. 72. This feat was in fact achieved on 23 October 1934, when Agello piloted the M.C. 72 for an average speed of 709 km/h over three passes. The M.C. 72 held the world speed record for all aircraft for five years and remained the fastest speed ever attained by a piston-engine seaplane.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202047;A visit in Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202047;In $YEAR$, the Emperor and the Empress of Austria visited Venice. The city was still aware of its lost independence, and nationalistic movements were around. In fact, the windows were locked and the streets empty. The Serenissima prepared a cold reception. Franz Josef mentioned later, that the silence "killed more than a bullet".;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202048;St Mark's Campanile;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202048;St Mark's Campanile (Campanile di San Marco in Italian) is the bell tower of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, located in the Piazza San Marco. It is one of the most recognizable symbols of the city. In July 1902, the north wall of the tower began to show signs of a dangerous crack that in the following days continued to grow. Finally, on Monday, July 14, around 9:45 am, the campanile collapsed completely, also demolishing the logetta. Remarkably, no one was killed, except for the caretaker's cat. Because of the campanile's position, the resulting damage was relatively limited. Apart from the logetta, only a corner of the Biblioteca Marciana was destroyed. The pietra del bando, a large porphyry column from which laws used to be read, protected the basilica itself. Nevertheless, the loss of one of the greatest symbols of old italian culture was discuessed in the whole nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202049;The Death of Leopardi;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202049;Giacomo Leopardi was an Italian poet, essayist, philosopher, and philologist. Although he lived in a secluded town in the ultra-conservative Papal States, he came in touch with the main thoughts of the Enlightenment, and, by his own literary evolution, created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the Romantic era. Leopardi often wrote about poetry in general and about his own idea of poetry, of its language and scope. Many pages on this subject can be found in the Zibaldone, a private diary and collection of notes, literary projects, translations, etc. Together with Alessandro Manzoni, Leopardi hat an immense impact on the Italian language and was one figurehead of patriotic and nationalistic movements in Italy. The greatest poet of italian Romanticism died at 38 years in Naples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202050;Giosuè Carducci;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202050;Giosuè Carducci, born 1835 in Valdicastello (Lucca), was an Italian poet and teacher. He was very influential and was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy, being a part of the general cultural and political life. Carducci was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. His political views were consistently opposed to Christianity generally and the secular power of the Catholic Church in particular. This anti-clerical revolutionary zeal is prominently showcased in one famous poem, the deliberately blasphemous and provocative 'Inno a Satana' (Hymn to Satan). While 'Inno a Satana' had quite a revolutionary impact, Carducci's finest poetry came in later years. His collections Rime Nuove (New Rhymes) and Odi Barbare (Barbarian Odes) contain his greatest works.  Carducci also translated some works  of Goethe and Heine into Italian. One year before his death, Carducci became the first Italian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202052;Gabriele D'Annunzio;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202052;Gabriele D'Annunzio was an Italian writer, poet, journalist, playwright and soldier. He occupied a prominent place in Italian literature and political life. He was nicknamed Il Vate (The Poet) and Il Profeta (The Prophet). D'Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French Symbolism and British Aestheticism. At the height of his success, D'Annunzio was celebrated for the originality, power and decadence of his writing and his work had immense impact across Europe and on generations of Italian writers. He came under the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche which would find outlets in his literary and later political contributions. In 1897 D'Annunzio was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where he sat as an independent. He collaborated with Debussy, Mascagni, Marinetti and took a flight with Wilbur Wright, becoming a pilot himself and a hero in air-battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202053;La Conoscienza di Svevo;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202053;Aron Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo, was an Italian writer and businessman, author of novels, plays, and short stories. Italo Svevo (literally Italian swabian) wrote the classic novel La Coscienza di Zeno (rendered as Confessions of Zeno, or Zeno's Conscience) and self-published it in 1923. The work, showing the author's interest in the theories of Sigmund Freud, is written in the form of the memoirs of one Zeno Cosini, who writes them at the insistence of his psychoanalyst. Schmitz's novel received almost no attention from Italian readers and critics at the time. The work might have disappeared altogether if it were not for the efforts of James Joyce. Joyce had met Svevo in 1907, when Joyce tutored him in English while working for Berlitz in Trieste. Joyce championed Confessions of Zeno, helping to have it translated into French and then published in Paris, where critics praised it extravagantly. That led Italian critics to discover it. Svevo was also a model for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Joyce's Ulysses.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202054;Gioachino Rossini;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202054;Gioachino Antonio Rossini was an Italian composer who wrote 39 operas as well as sacred music, chamber music, songs, and some instrumental and piano pieces. His best-known operas include the Italian comedies Il barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville) and La Cenerentola and the French-language epics Moïse et Pharaon and Guillaume Tell. A tendency for inspired, song-like melodies is evident throughout his scores, which led to the nickname "The Italian Mozart". Until his retirement in 1829, Rossini had been the most popular opera composer in history. He returned to the Papal States, namely Bologna, where he became dircetor of music, spending his time by composing chamber and sacred music.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202055;Donizetti's Caterina Cornaro;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202055;Gaetano Donizetti was an Italian composer from Bergamo, Lombardy. Along with Vincenzo Bellini and Gioachino Rossini, he was a leading composer of bel canto opera. Following the success of Linda di Chamounix, Caterina Cornaro was commissioned by Bartolomeo Merelli, impresario of the Kaertnerthortheater in Vienna, and was partly composed in 1842/1843. The Viennese realised that the same subject had been set to music the preceding year by Franz Lachner and the debut was cancelled. Two months after the triumph of Dom Sébastien in Paris, Caterina was booed at the San Carlo in Naples. The composer, who had been unable to be present at rehearsals or to oversee the orchestration, had clearly predicted the opera's failure: "I am anxiously awaiting news of the fiasco of Caterina Cornaro in Naples. La Goldberg as a primadonna is my first disaster without knowing it. I wrote for a soprano, they give me a mezzo! God knows if Coletti, if Fraschini intend their roles as I intend them. God knows what a catastrophe censorship has brought.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202056;Cavalleria rusticana;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202056;Cavalleria rusticana (Rustic Chivalry) is an opera in one act by Pietro Mascagni to an Italian libretto by Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti and Guido Menasci, and considered one of the classic verismo operas. Although Mascagni had started writing two other operas earlier (Pinotta, premiered in 1932 and Guglielmo Ratcliff, premiered in 1895), Cavalleria rusticana was his first opera to be completed and performed. It remains the best known of his fifteen operas and one operetta. Its success has been phenomenal from its first performance in the Teatro Costanzi in Rome until the present day. At the time of Mascagni's death in 1945, the opera had been performed more than 14,000 times in Italy alone. The first performance of Cavalleria rusticana caused a sensation, with Mascagni taking 40 curtain calls on the opening night, and winning the First Prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202057;Fountains of Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202057;Ottorino Respighi was an Italian composer, musicologist and conductor. His musicological interest in 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century music led him to also compose pieces based on the music of this period. He also wrote a number of operas, the best known being La fiamma. He is best known for his orchestral "Roman trilogy": Fountains of Rome (Le fontane di Roma), Pines of Rome (I pini di Roma), and Roman Festivals (Feste romane). Fountains of Rome is a sinfonic poem, seperated in four sections, depicting one of Rome's fountains during different periods of the day and night. Although the premiere in Rome was unsuccessful, Arturo Toscanini finally conducted the work in Milan in 1918 with tremendous success.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202058;Nessun dorma;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202058;Giacomo Puccini was an Italian composer whose operas are among the most frequently performed in the standard repertoire and considered the greatest Italian composer of opera after Verdi. While his early work was rooted in traditional late-19th century romantic Italian opera, he successfully developed his work in the "realistic" verismo style, of which he became one of the leading exponents. Turandot, Puccini's final opera, was left unfinished, and the last two scenes were completed by Franco Alfano based on the composer's sketches. The libretto for Turandot was based on a play by Carlo Gozzi, also called Turandot. The music of the opera is heavily inflected with pentatonic motifs, intended to produce an Asiatic flavor to the music. Unlike La Fanciulla, Turandot contains a number of memorable stand-alone arias, among them Nessun dorma. The first performance was held at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan and conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202059;Aida;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202059;Aida is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni, based on a scenario often attributed to French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, although it has been argued that the scenario was actually written by Temistocle Solera. Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, commissioned Verdi to write the opera for performance in January $YEAR$, paying him 150,000 francs, but the premiere was delayed. Aida met with great acclaim when it finally opened in Cairo on 24 December $YEAR$. The costumes and accessories for the premiere were designed by Auguste Mariette, and he oversaw the design and construction of the sets, which were created in Paris and shipped to Cairo. Although Verdi did not attend the premiere in Cairo, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian (and European) premiere, held at La Scala, Milan, and in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202061;Rigoletto;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202061;Rigoletto is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi. The Italian libretto was written on the play Le roi s'amuse by Victor Hugo. It was first performed at La Fenice in Venice in $YEAR$. Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over Northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere and is considered by many to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career, being the first of his three "Popular" operas (Il Trovatore and La Traviata conclude the trilogy). Rigoletto premiered to a sold out La Fenice and was a complete triumph, especially the scena drammatica, and the Duke's cynical aria, 'La donna è mobile' which was sung in the streets the next morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202063;The Requiem;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202063;On 22 May 1873, the Italian writer and humanist Alessandro Manzoni, whom Verdi had admired all his adult life and met in 1868, died. Upon hearing of his death, Verdi resolved to complete a Requiem for the most important Italian writer of the 19th century. The Requiem was first performed in the church of San Marco in Milan and three days later at the Scala. Verdi conducted himself. It won immediate contemporary success, and became a national celebration of arts, as two of the greatest cultural personalities of Italy - one in the field of music, one in the field of literature - merged together in an allegory of artistic spirit. As to the music qua music, the critical consensus agreed that the work displayed "fluent invention, beautiful sound effects and charming vocal writing." Critics were divided between praise and condemnation with respect to Verdis willingness to break standard compositional rules for musical effect, such as his use of consecutive fifths.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202065;Restaurazione ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202065;Following the defeat of Napoleonic France, the Congress of Vienna was convened to redraw the European continent. In Italy, the Congress restored the pre-Napoleonic patchwork of independent governments, either directly ruled or strongly influenced by the prevailing European powers, particularly Austria, since the Empire directly controlled the predominantly Italian-speaking northeastern part of present-day Italy and were, together, the most powerful force against unification. The Austrian Empire vigorously repressed nationalist sentiment growing on the Italian peninsula, as well as in the other parts of Habsburg domains. The Austrian diplomat von Metternich stated that the word Italy was nothing more than "a geographic expression". One of the most influential revolutionary groups was the Carbonari, a secret organization formed in Southern Italy. Artistic and literary sentiment also turned towards nationalism, provoking a climate, in which the Resurgence of Italy would occur: The Risorgimento.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC200001;Romantic sentiment and evolving nationalistic spirit of our people have evoked a high interest in the medieval age, which is seen as the root of the German culture. A symbol of these far away and backward times are the cathedrals of gothic architectural style. Cologne, once the biggest German city, and one of the finest places in the times of the Holy Roman Empire, has one of the greatest cathredrals in human history - which is a large, abandoned construction area. Founded in the 13th century, the building work was suspended in the 1530s. Even the old construction crane is there above! Since 1814, when the construction plans were found again by Georg Moller in Darmstadt, there were several voices to revive the work of our ancestors - and new founded societies have argued, that this project should not be only a private intention.

EVTDESC200008;Immediately upon his arrival in Hanover, the new King Ernest August dissolved the parliament which had been convened under the disputed constitution. He proclaimed the suspension of the constitution, on the ground that his consent had not been asked, and that it did not meet the kingdom's needs. The King issued a patent, declaring the constitution void, but upholding all laws passed under it. The 1819 constitution was restored. In carrying the King's patent into effect, the Cabinet required all officeholders (including professors at Göttingen University) to renew their oaths of allegiance to the King. Seven professors (including the two Brothers Grimm) refused to take the oaths, and agitated for others to protest against the King's decree. Since they did not take the oaths, the seven lost their positions, and the King expelled the three most responsible (including Jacob Grimm) from Hanover. However, he was widely criticised in other parts of Germany and Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC200014;In 1836, the states of the German Confederation were in the middle of the so-called 'Vormärz' (pre-March). The name derived from the later (failed) revolution in the March of 1848, and was a period which was shaped by the Austrian and Prussian police states, the censorship of the press and restricted freedoms. But it was also the time of German romanticism, evolving nationalism and great personalities, which made Germany to the land of poets and thinkers.

EVTNAME200019;Deutsches Wörterbuch;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200019;Das Deutsche Wörterbuch (The German Dictionary) is one of the most important dictionaries of the German language. It is for German what the Oxford English Dictionary is for English, containing detailed historical information about the origin and use over time of German words, with examples taken from actual documents. In German the dictionary is also known as "Der Grimm". It was started by the Grimm brothers (known also for Grimms' Fairy Tales) in 1838.  Initially the Grimm brothers expected the project to take ten years and produce 67 volumes. In fact, the first volume was not published until 1854. Wilhelm Grimm died in 1859, and Jacob in 1863, while working on the entry for 'Frucht' (fruit). After their deaths multiple institutions were involved in the work, including the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Berlin Academy, with a center in Goettingen also involved. Finally completed in 1961, the dictionary will contain 32 volumes and include about 350,000 main entries. The "Grimm" was not only a scientific, but also national work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200021;Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200021;In 1843, the German poet Heinrich Heine, who left Germany 1831 for France, went back for a few weeks, visiting his mother and publisher Julius Campe in Hamburg. Heine was not a typical romantic author, but more a satirical one who criticized the reactionary policy and censorship of the authoritarian German states, but also his nationalistic and chauvinistic compatriots. On the return journey to Paris, the first draft of 'Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen' (Germany: A Winter's Tale) took shape. The verse epic appeared in 1844 published by Hoffmann and Campe, Hamburg. According to the censorship regulations of the Carlsbad Conference of 1819, manuscripts of more than twenty folios did not fall under the scrutiny of the censor. Therefore it was published together with other poems in a volume called New Poems. The work showed Heines world of images and his folk-song-like poetic diction in a compact gathering, with cutting, ironic criticisms of the circumstances in his homeland. Heines verse-epic was much debated in Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200029;Germanistentag 1846;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200029;In 1846, a conference of German historians, philologists and lawyers was held in Frankfurt. German history, law and language were debated topics, but also political issues like the question regarding a national state. Prominent personalities of this remarkable meeting of German thinkers were Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, Georg Waitz and Johann Gustav Droysen. Venue was the old townhall of Frankfurt, the 'Römer'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200031;Germanistentag 1847;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200031;In 1847, a conference of German historians, philologists and lawyers was held in Frankfurt. 170 academics under the leadership of Jacob Grimm debated on history, law and language, but also political issues. The conference was described as an "intellectual assembly of the German people". On the last day, when a banquet was held in the old townshall of Lubeck, Heinrich Carl Jaup demanded a general citizenship as a first step towards a unified nation state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200034;The Constitutional Conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200034;Like Baden, Hesse-Kassel had a rather liberal constitution. But after the liberal revolution, Elector Friedrich Wilhelm assigned a reactionary government and conducted an unpopular policy against the traditional liberties. The most radical step were his decrees, which were against the constitution. A conflict between the elector and the parliament evolved, ending in the suspension of the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200035;Humboldt's Kosmos;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200035;Kosmos (usually referred to in English as 'Cosmos') was an influential treatise on science and nature written by the German scientist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt. Kosmos began as a lecture series delivered by Humboldt at the University of Berlin, and was published in five volumes between 1845 and 1862 (the fifth was posthumous and incomplete). Widely read by academics and laymen alike, it applied the ancient Greek view of the orderliness of the cosmos (the universe) to the Earth, suggesting that universal laws applied as well to the apparent chaos of the terrestrial world. Controversially for the time, Humboldt in Kosmos spoke of the spirituality of the natural world only in general terms, avoiding the notion of a creator.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200036;Robert Schumann;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200036;Robert Schumann is regarded as one of the most representative composers of the Romantic era. In 1850, he suceeded Ferdinand Hiller as musical director and moved to Düsseldorf. Although criticized regarding his poor conductor skills and scoffed because of his "creative decay", Schumann composed his last symphony, the 'Rhenish'. He used Beethoven's and Mendelssohn's symphonies as a model, but was also inspired by his impressions of the Rhineland. Schumann himself stated, that his journey to Cologne and the sight of the cathedral were his main inspiration for this composition, which became one of his most famous works.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200037;Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200037;Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy was a German composer, pianist, organist and conductor of the early Romantic period. Early success in Germany, where he also revived interest in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, was followed by travel throughout Europe. His essentially conservative musical tastes, however, set him apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook. His Violin Concerto was his last large orchestral work and is one of the most popular and most frequently performed violin concertos of all time. The concerto was first performed in Leipzig on 13 March 1845 with Ferdinand David as soloist. Mendelssohn was unable to conduct due to illness and the premiere was conducted by the Danish composer Niels Gade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200038;Franz Liszt;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200038;Franz Liszt became renowned in Europe during the nineteenth century for his virtuosic skill as a pianist. He was said by his contemporaries to have been the most technically advanced pianist of his age. In the 1840s he was considered by some to be perhaps the greatest pianist of all time. He was also a well-known composer, piano teacher, and conductor. He was a benefactor to other composers, including Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg and Alexander Borodin. He left behind an extensive and diverse body of work in which he influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated some 20th-century ideas and trends. When Liszt took up a long-standing invitation of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia to settle at Weimar, the most important period of his creative work began. Liszt had ample time to compose and during the next 12 years revised or produced those orchestral and choral pieces upon which his reputation as a composer mainly rested.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200039;Johannes Brahms;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200039;Johannes Brahms was a German composer and pianist, and one of the leading musicians of the Romantic period. Born in Hamburg, Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna, Austria, where he was a leader of the musical scene. In his lifetime, Brahms's popularity and influence were considerable. Following a comment by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von Bülow, he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the Three Bs. Brahms composed for piano, chamber ensembles, symphony orchestra, and for voice and chorus. A virtuoso pianist, he premiered many of his own works and worked with some of the leading performers of his time. It was the premiere of A German Requiem, his largest choral work, in Bremen, in 1868, that confirmed Brahms's European reputation and led many to accept that he had conquered Beethoven and the symphony. This gave him the confidence finally to complete a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200040;Schubert's 'Unfinished';;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200040;Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 in B minor, commonly known as the 'Unfinished Symphony' (German: Unvollendete), was started in 1822 but left with only two movements known to be complete, even though Schubert would live for another six years. After his death, the work fell into oblivion, until Johann von Herbeck found it in the possession of Schubert's friend Anselm Hüttenbrenner in 1865. Herbeck conducted the symphony in the same year, and the performance was met with great enthusiams by the audience. The work is often referred to as Schuberts first romantic symphony owing to its emphasis on expressive melody, vivid harmony, and creative combinations of orchestral tone color. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200041;Johann Strauss;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200041;Johann Strauss was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely then responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century. Some of Johann Strauss's most famous works include The Blue Danube, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known. The operetta 'Die Fledermaus' premièred on 5 April 1874 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, and has been part of the regular operetta repertoire ever since.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200042;Gustav Mahler;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200042;Gustav Mahler was a late-Romantic Austrian composer and one of the leading conductors of his generation. As a composer, he acted as a bridge between the 19th century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). His innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner and Mozart.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200043;Richard Strauss;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200043;Richard Georg Strauss was a leading German composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. He is known for his operas, which include Der Rosenkavalier and Salome, his Lieder - especially his Four Last Songs - and his tone poems and other orchestral works, such as Death and Transfiguration, Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks, Also sprach Zarathustra, An Alpine Symphony, and Metamorphosen. Strauss was also a prominent conductor throughout Germany and Austria. Strauss, along with Gustav Mahler, represents the late flowering of German Romanticism after Richard Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of orchestration are combined with an advanced harmonic style. In 1905, Strauss produced Salome, a somewhat dissonant modernist opera based on the play by Oscar Wilde, in 1909 followd Elektra. Both were performed in Dresden for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200044;Anton Bruckner;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200044;Anton Bruckner was an Austrian composer known for his symphonies, masses, and motets. The first are considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German Romanticism because of their rich harmonic language, strongly polyphonic character, and considerable length. Bruckner's compositions helped to define contemporary musical radicalism, owing to their dissonances, unprepared modulations, and roving harmonies. Unlike other musical radicals, such as Richard Wagner or Hugo Wolf who fit the enfant terrible mould, Bruckner showed extreme humility before other musicians, Wagner in particular. The apparent dichotomy between Bruckner the man and Bruckner the composer hampers efforts to describe his life in a way that gives a straightforward context for his music. His works, the symphonies in particular, had detractors, most notably the influential Austrian critic Eduard Hanslick, and other supporters of Johannes Brahms. He died in 1896.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200045;Arnold Schönberg;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200045;Arnold Schönberg was an Austrian composer and painter, associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School. In the 1920s, Schönberg developed the twelve-tone technique, a widely influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation, and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea. Schönberg was also a painter, an important music theorist, and an influential teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200046;Mondnacht;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200046;Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff was a German poet and novelist of the later German romantic school. Eichendorff's guiding poetic theme was that Man should find happiness in full absorption of the beauties and changing moods of Nature. The lyricism of Eichendorff's poetry is much praised, and his poems have been set by many composers, including Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hans Pfitzner, and Alexander Zemlinsky. In 1837, his poem 'Mondnacht' (Night of the Moon) was published, which is often seen as the "pearl of pearls" of German romantic lyricism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200047;Carl Spitzweg;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200047;Carl Spitzweg was a German romanticist painter and poet. He is considered to be one of the most important artists of the Biedermeier era. His father, a wealthy merchant, had Carl trained as a pharmacist. He attained his qualification from the University of Munich, but while recovering from an illness he also took up painting. Spitzweg was self-taught as an artist, and began by copying the works of Flemish masters. He contributed his first work to satiric magazines. Upon receiving an inheritance in 1833, he was able to dedicate himself to painting. His later paintings and drawings were often humorous genre works. In 1839, his first painting 'The Poor Poet' was published. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME200052;The Weavers;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200052;In $YEAR$, Gerhart Hauptmann's play The Weavers was first performed. Most of the characters are proletarians struggling for their rights. Unlike most plays of any period, as pointed out many times in literature criticism and introductions, the play has no true central character, providing ample opportunities for ensemble acting. Instead of a hero, Hauptmann created a mob. This mob is therefore the protagonist - or chief character - and if individuals emerge from the rank and file they are not thrust into the foreground to stay long. The historical background was the Weavers' Uprising in the 1840s.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC500001;After our country was came out of the latest war, our subjects in Congress Poland and other parts of our empire are getting restless. The uprising began as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Imperial Russian Army. It was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and various politicians. In Vilnius alone 116 demonstrations were held in $YEAR$. Much of these manifestations in Vilnius ended in clashes with the Imperial Russian Army. In spite of Russian police and Cossack interference, a symbolic meeting of hymn-singing Poles and Lithuanians took place on the bridge across Niemen River. The crowds sang "God protect Poland" in Lithuanian and Belarusian. Earlier in $YEAR$ Russians had introduced a state of emergency in Vilna Governorate, Kovno Governorate and Grodno Governorate.

The image of Poland as the Christ of Europe was first evoked by Adam Mickiewicz in his tragic poetical play Dziady (1832), written in the aftermath of the country's unsuccessful 1830 uprising against the Russian Empire, considered by some to be one of the great works of European romanticism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC188129;King Frederick William IV of Prussia amnestied the Polish prisoners, who found a Polish Legion, and were armed with weapons from the Royal Prussian Arsenal. Speeches during the demonstration were made about joint fight against Russian Empire to free Congress Poland. Inspired by the events in Berlin, a demonstration in Poznañ was organized and the authorities agreed to creation of delegation that would bring proposals of Polish side to Berlin and to the Prussian King. A Polish National Committee, dominated by conservatives and liberals, was formed. Armed peasants and townspeople attacked Prussian administrative offices and clashed with troops. Meanwhile, the National Committee, which would have been satisfied with autonomy for the duchy, entered into negotiations with the Prussian authorities, counting on concessions from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC188130;After the Ausgleich, representatives of the Polish aristocracy and intelligentsia addressed the Emperor asking for greater autonomy for Galicia. Their demands were not accepted outright, but over the course of the next several years a number of significant concessions were made toward the establishment of Galician autonomy. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of Austria-Hungary with Polish and, to a much lesser degree, Ukrainian or Ruthenian, as official languages. The Germanisation had been halted and the censorship lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the Galicia Diet and provincial administration had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC188131;Frédéric François Chopin, a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist, died today in Paris. He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of this era, whose "poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation." Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, and grew up in Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed many of his works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. Chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform at London's Guildhall on 16 November 1848, when, in a final patriotic gesture, he played for the benefit of Polish refugees.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Diet of 1839-40 refused to proceed to business till the political prisoners had been released, and, while in the Lower Chamber the reforming majority was larger than ever, a Liberal party was now also formed in the Upper House. Among the positive steps taken by the Diet of 1839-40 was the new urbarial law permitting individual serfs, as well as entire communities, to pay a fixed sum as manumission compensation, thus opening the way for serfs to become free landowners. The Diet also acted to safeguard the free development of industrial enterprises and to limit child labor and decided to prepare a new penal code on the basis of the best avaliable foreing sources, including American.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC188133;Alternately resisting and yielding to the pressures of clashing linguistic nationalisms, the Austrian authorities were less willing to make concessions in the economic sphere. Both chambers of the Diet of 1843-44 jointly requested the modification of internal tariffs separating Hungary from the rest of the Habsburg lands. This plea, of concern to liberals and conservatives alike, recieved only evasive answer. Indignantly, the predominantly liberal Chamber of Deputies passed a resolution supporting the recently founded National Protective Association.

Revolutionaries marched into the streets of Budapest to visit various plazas and loudly recite their 12 Points, gathering a fast-growing crowd of sympathizers to join their movement. Before long, thousands of fired-up Budapest citizens were parading through the city, defying censorship by seizing the presses to print and distribute the 12 Points.

According to one of Makarczyk's later accounts, the treaty was also supposed to include a secret clause that allowed the League to recruit up to 100,000 Liberians to the Polish Army in case of war. The League was planning to promote a large-scale Polish settlement in Liberia. A group of Polish pioneers boarded the vessel S.S. Poznañ, which took them from Gdynia to Monrovia. Polish farms were established in Liberia but did not bring large profits due to small investments flowing in from Poland. With time, Liberia became frightened by reckless articles in the Polish press that labeled the Black Republic as practically a Polish colony.

Austrian rule, after realising that mutually-agreeable home rule would not be possible, exploited Venetian resources, economically and politically, favouring Trieste as the imperial seaport. Within 50 years of their acquisition of the former republic, Austria had taken more from the region than had been spent there and Venetian capitalism had been stifled by a reluctance on the part of the slow, bureaucratic Habsburg régime to grant credit to Venetian entrepreneurs.

While conservatives in Bengali society might be unimpressed with its lucidity, it accessibility is sure to be a draw to the people.\n\nBengali culture has been undergoing a sort of renaissance in recent decades. Starting with the works of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, an appreciation for the richness of India's past has grown together with an examination of the impact of the modern West upon it.

EVTNAME211490;A Historic Kris;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211490;In South Asian culture, a kris (an asymmetrical, usually curvy, dagger) is a spiritual and sacred object. Imbued with magical powers, they are thought to be inhabited by spirits and as such are "almost alive". Care of krisses is subject to great ceremony and ritual. Should the owner be negligent, the Kris might kill him in his sleep. Should the owner, however, be generous, the kris will protect him and imbue him with valour.\nRecently, the crown-prince of one of our Princely States fell ill. Neither our western physicians, nor the local Dukun proved capable of helping. In a desperate move, the prince asked the renowned 'White Dukun,' a Dutchman educated in both western and indigenous medicine, for help. Finding it as a case of guna-guna, the White Dukun worked his magic and managed to cure the crown-prince.

Of particular importance is 's Lands Plantentuin (the botanical gardens) surrounding the palace.

He has shown particular aptitude towards painting portraits, and many a ruler has been immortalised by his work. His landscapes too are a sight to behold. Inspired by his native land, the paintings show exquisite detail in the wild animals he depicts. But perhaps his most important work is his depiction of the capture of Prince Diponegoro at the Java War, provocatively depicting a noble prince Diponegoro and slightly "unbalanced" colonial officers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME210460;Belgian-Dutch Language and Literature Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC210460;While a large part of our population speaks Dutch, it has never been a very important language. At court, in government and among the bourgeoisie French is 'la langue preferee', and Dutch is looked down onto with some disdain. This has left precious little room in our country for the development of the language. The situation is different of course by our neighbour to the north. The Dutch have proven more supportive of the Flemish, and both Dutch and Flemish scholars have now come together in Gent to discuss the language. The hope is to form a more unified and standardised language, and in imitation of German and French efforts, create an extensive dictionary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC211590;One of the causes of the Belgian Revolution was our language policy. The majority of the elites, being Francophone, disdained Dutch and our efforts to make it the national language. It should thus come as no surprise that, after independence, French was swiftly elected as the official language. This has caused some resentment among the Flemish, who find it gives precious little room for their own cultural expression.\nIn an effort to strengthen the cultural base of Dutch in Belgium, Flemish language scholars have joined up with Dutch language scholars in Ghent for an international language and literature congress.

EVTNAME211591;The First Dictionary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211591;For much of history, there has not been a unified Dutch language. Numerous regional varieties exists, with Hollandic Dutch being the most prominent. A movement towards a unified language does exist, but it hampered by a lack of an unambiguous structure of the language. Official rules regarding the language do exist, but they too show regional differences. Language scholars have now recommended to create one national dictionary, and get rid of the regional differences in spelling and pronunciation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211592;The Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211592;After many years of work, the first true dictionary of the Dutch language has been produced: The Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal. While there may have been earlier dictionaries, perhaps most famously by 16th century scholar Kiliaan, none of these were of the calibre of this new dictionary. They were mainly translation dictionaries, or used regional spelling differences. The 'Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederandsche Taal' uses the new (official and unified) spelling rules.\n\nThe dictionary as released is only the first of a large series. The aim of the dictionary is to describe every word in use in the Dutch language since 1500. Such a massive task will take many more years to complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As a teacher he aimed his dictionary at students, and desired a clear cut and precise definition of words.\n\nThe dictionary is often referred to as 'De Dikke van Dale' [The Thick one by van Dale], because, at 1400 pages, it is the thickest book in the common household, after the Bible of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC211601;A mayor fire has turned the entire medieval city of Enschede to ashes. 650 houses were destroyed, which in a city of only 4000 people means more than half of all citizens are left homeless. A number of factors can be blamed, drought, strong winds, improper fireproofing, but our own contribution to the fire should not be overlooked: in celebration of the king's visit the city was beautifully decorated with flowers, banners and triumphal arches. All of which proved to be very conductive to the spread of the fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211602;From The Life Of King Gorilla;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211602;King William has always been an odd bird. This is nothing new, but at least it had been kept out of the press. The (conservative) press has willingly swept it under the carpet all this time. The more radical press is less willing to cover it though. It would seem the madness of the king has reached socialist circles: a pamphlet called 'A Day in the Life of King Gorilla' was recently released and has become quite popular. The pamphlet describes "the criminal life" and the "corrupted nature" of the royal house, calling the king an unconsidered "sadistic monster" who cares not about his people.\nThis, combined with another recent pamphlet describing the king as "a regal pig" and "horny mandrill", triggered some passionate feelings.

EVTNAME211400;The Cultuurstelsel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211400;The wars with Belgium, on Java and on Sumatra have drained the treasury, and we are quickly heading toward financial ruin. To increase the revenue from our colonies in the East, a new system called the Cultuurstelsel has been proposed, which will require farmers to grow cash crops for export. Replacing the old Landrente-tax, which required farmers to pay 2/5th of their harvest as tax, the Cultuurstelsel requires farmers to use 1/5th of their land to grow cash crops, mainly coffee, tea, sugar and indigo. Farmers who cannot grow these crops on their land are required to provide the Herendienst: 60 days of free labour per year to work on government plantations. Should the value of crops exceed the previously paid Landrente, the farmer is compensated accordingly by the Plantloon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211403;Overzealous Colonial Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211403;One of our lower colonial officers, an assistant-resident in Western Java, has taken a very zealous approach to his job. Disturbed by the abuses of the Cultuurstelsel and Herendienst he found in his regency, he accused the local Head of severe abuse of power and bondage of his subjects. While of course his position requires him to reign in local excesses and protect the populace, his primary concern should be the protection of our interests! Currently, the authority of the Head is sacred and unquestionable to the populace. Bringing him to court might cause severe social upheaval. As such, the Resident has called the Assistent-Resident to order and stopped the prosecution of the Head. This did not deter the Assistent-Resident. The case has now reached the Governor-General who has to decided to continue the prosecution, and risk rebellion, or put a stop to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211404;Disgruntled Colonial Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211404;A former colonial officer who left the service after an altercation with a local Regent, has now written to you complaining about the treatment he has received. A fervent liberal and proponent of inlander rights, he claims to have written a book detailing abuses committed by both the colonial government and local Heads under the Cultuurstelsel. Having been reduced to poverty by his treatment, he is threatening to publish this book unless he is fully rehabilitated, which in this case means: a position of Regent on Java, full restoration of his pension, a large advance and, most preposterously, a decoration for his "service".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211405;Multatuli;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211405;"I am broker in coffee, and live on the Lauriersgracht No. 37."\nWith these words begins the novel Max Havelaar, which has by now "sent a shudder through the land". The novel describes the consequences of the colonial system in Java, in which government and local Heads cooperated to enrich themselves at the expense of the people. In the example of the body of the Javanese, murdered on the orders of the regent, floating down the river as a present from the sharks of the interior to the sharks in the sea, after that poor wretch had complained about the Regent, the "humdrum" story of that one buffalo of Saidjah's father, the village in Lampung set ablaze by Dutch forces. Cumulating in the majestic, almost terrifying, final chord in which Multatuli exposed Holland as a "pirate state" among the nations, and conjured the king not to tolerate any longer that more than 30 million Javanese are maltreated and exploited in his name in the "glorious realm of Insulinde, that coiled round the Equator like a girdle of emerald".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211409;Java, or How to Manage a Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211409;Long has our colony on Java been the envy of the world. The vast wealth provided by the Cultuurstelsel has propelled our nation forwards, and this has not gone unnoticed abroad. In a recently published book, called 'Java, or How to Manage a Colony', the aptly named Englishman James Money described our colonial administration of Java, the Cultuurstelsel in particular, as the example of how a colony should be run. He writes that a similar system would solve many of the problems facing British India today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211411;The Koloniale Kwestie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211411;"A weighty responsibility lies on the people blessed with such history as ours. Contemporaries and progeny might rightfully question, what we, sons of such a dearly bought freedom, have done with this freedom? Can we, after three centuries, with a clean concious and our heads held high answer: We are worthy descendants of such heroes? Is it but lies and slander that we exploit the Javanese?\n[...]\nThe Cultuurstelsel has made our country the disgrace of the world. We have surrendered the honour of being a civilised nation: for even the Spanish did not treat our forefathers so unchristian."\nThat a moral nation pur sang like ours, which does not rely on brute force but moral superiority in international politics, should allow for her subjects to be exploited, has started to create a feeling of unease in society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211900;Maatschappij tot Nut van den Javaan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211900;A new 'Society to the Benefit of the Javanese' has been founded with to combat all injustice against Javanese, no matter the source. The society considers it a great sin that, in our name, Javanese should be exploited. Being the foremost Christian nation under God, it should fall to us to uplift the inlanders! Perhaps under our guidance can the Javanese can do away with their superstitions and join the ranks of civilised peoples. The society has started to raise money to fund (Christian) schools in the East.\nThe paternalistic nature of the society, however, has not fallen well with more liberal elements of our society. Multatuli, perhaps the foremost "friend of the Javanese", has published a damning commentary of their work: "He who does indeed value Civilisation does not ridicule her by spreading more or less illustrated school books, prints and atlases to those who he systematically exploits, abuses and murders".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211901;Baron Van Hoevell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211901;"People of the Netherlands, does a bloodguilt not burn on your consciousness? For two centuries has your flag flow on Java: For two centuries you have waived the sceptre of domination: Millions upon millions have flowed to your treasure on the toiling of the inlanders: And you have returned nothing to them."\nMember of Parliament Wolter Robert baron van Hoevell has emerged as one of the strongest critics of our colonial administration of Java and the Cultuurstelsel in particular. Originally serving as a minister in Batavia, he was forced to leave the Indies due to his liberal and anti-governmental tendencies. Very popular in the Indies: it is said that when he left, he was sent of by "half of Batavia". As one of the few MPs who has actually visited the Indies, he can describe the situation there with great expertise and "disturbing eloquence".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211418;The Agrarische Wet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211418;While vital for the financial well-being of our nation, the Cultuurstelsel has its opponents. Especially in liberal circles there is a lot of criticism of the system. They view the Cultuurstelsel as an inefficient and inflexible economic system, unable to respond adequately to changing circumstance. In their view the East Indies would benefit from opening up to private capital. The treatment of the Inlanders is also a point of contention. They hold the Cultuurstelsel as deeply immoral, as it denies the local education, Christianity and the blessings of progress. The Agrarische Wet seeks to abolish the Cultuurstelsel and its governmental plantations, and open the East Indies up to private investment. Ownership of the land is returned to the Inlanders and western individuals can lease lands from them or the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211440;The Suikerwet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211440;The Agrarische Wet has been the first step in abolishing the Cultuurstelsel. However due its economic importance, the sugar industry had been exempted from the Agrarische Wet. This never set well with the liberal elements of society, and they have always pushed to end the governmental monopoly on sugar. A bill has now been brought to a vote in parliament to this effect.\nUnder the Suikerwet the government relinquishes its monopoly on sugar, and opens the sugar market to private capital, provided the sugar is refined in Dutch refineries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211441;The Koffiewet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211441;While in the days of the VOC spices such nutmeg and cloves might have been the economic motor of the Indies, since the late 18th century coffee has been the cork keeping our economy afloat. Therefore, when the Agrarische Wet was passed, the coffee cultures were specifically exempted. This never set right with the liberals and other proponents of a liberal economy. A bill has now been brought to a vote in parliament to finally bring an end to Cultuurstelsel, and the governmental monopoly on the coffee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211445;The Ethische Politiek;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211445;The Indies have always been a profit centre to our nation. While great wealth has flowed to our great nation, the poor inlanders have seen little benefit from our rule. In fact, they have suffered dearly from abuse and exploitation under our rule. Some would say we have incurred a debt of honour towards the inlanders. They are proposing we follow a more Ethical Policy towards the inlanders. We would take ethical responsibility towards our inlander populace, and extend all benefits from being part of our great nation towards them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211800;The Pill Bandoeng;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211800;Malaria is an ever present danger in the tropical regions of the world. There are few effective treatments for the disease, and those which do exist are expensive. Our control over the production of Quinine from the Cinchona tree has given our citizens abundant and relatively cheap access to the medicine. However, the inlander population has been unable to profit from this, and continues to be ravaged by the disease.

In $YEAR$ political agitators in Palermo circulated a pamphlet which called on all Sicilians to rise up against the Bourbons on Ferdinand's birthday. By the time the Bourbon troops arrived by sea, the revolutionaries were in control of the city and then the whole island. As the Neapolitan army retreated, those with a more defined political agenda emerged as the leaders and established committees in an effort to channel and control the momentum of the uprising. They demanded that Ferdinand restore the 1812 constitution, an appeal which attracted support from the middle and upper classes. In response, the king offered local self-government on condition that Bourbon sovereignty remained, but the revolutionaries rejected this and insisted that Sicily should have complete independence from Naples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although Bulgaria was technically under the suzerainty of the Sublime Porte, this was a legal fiction that Bulgaria only acknowledged in a formal way and acted largely as a de facto independent state. In $YEAR$, a rebellion and coup in Eastern Rumelia, led by Bulgarians, saw the people proclaim a union with the state of Bulgaria. According to the Berlin Treaty the Sultan was only allowed to send troops in Eastern Rumelia at the request of the governor, who at the time was a Bulgarian patriot and made no such request.

These measures did not mean that Uruguay's early decades were easy or calm, however: in addition to threats from its much larger neighbors, the young nation suffered from internal strife. The new constitution had made José Fructuoso Rivera the country's first president. When his political rival, Manuel Oribe became president in 1834, Fructuoso revolted against him. By the mid-1830s, two fiercely opposed political parties had emerged from these internal struggles. Oribe headed a group called the Blancos, who mainly represented gauchos, shepherds, and other rural citizens. Fructuoso led their opponents, the Colorados, who were more supportive of the residents of Montevideo and their business interests.

The new border, dubbed the Durand Line, would divide the Pashtun tribal lands, a region informally referred to as Pasthunistan in two, with half of the Pashtun tribal region now part of British India and the balance remaining part of Afghanistan.

EVTDESC36982;By $YEAR$, Franklin and his crew had been gone for years.

John Rae discovered further evidence of the expedition's fate. Rae met an Inuk who told him of a party of 35 to 40 white men who had died of starvation near the mouth of the Back River. Other Inuit confirmed this story, which included reports of cannibalism among the dying sailors. The Inuit showed Rae many objects that were identified as having belonged to Franklin and his men.

EVTNAME46628;The Venezuelan Crisis of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46628;In 1814, Great Britain had acquired British Guiana by treaty with the Netherlands. Because the treaty did not define a western boundary, the British commissioned Robert Schomburgk, a surveyor and naturalist, to delineate that boundary. His survey resulted in what came to be known as the Schomburgk Line, a boundary that effectively claimed an additional 30,000 square miles for Guiana. Venezuela claimed its borders extended as far east as the Essequibo Riveran effective claim on two-thirds of British Guianas territory. When gold was discovered in the disputed territory, Great Britain sought to further extend its reach, claiming an additional 33,000 square miles west of the Schomburgk Line, an area where gold had been discovered. In $YEAR$ Venezuela protested, broke diplomatic relations with Great Britain, and appealed to the United States for assistance, citing the Monroe Doctrine as justification for US involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME37252;General Boulanger;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37252;A graduate of the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, Georges Boulanger entered the army in 1856 and saw service in Italy, Algeria, Indochina, and the Franco-German War. Wounded in suppressing the Paris Commune, he was appointed brigadier general and director of infantry. Two years later he was appointed to command the army in North Africa but was recalled because of differences of opinion with the governor of the protectorate. Returning to Paris, he began to take part in politics and in $YEAR$ he entered the government as minister of war. He won popularity in the army through various reforms (improvement of soldiers' food and living conditions, and so on), heavy expenditures on the army, and his aggressive hostility towards Germany. Boulanger talked of avenging the defeat that France had suffered in the conflict with the Germans - which earned him the nickname Général Revanche - and he won some distinguished adherents by his denunciation of party divisions and corruption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME37253;The Rise of Boulangism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37253;Boulanger began to receive unsolicited electoral support in special elections for the Chamber of Deputies. The government feared his support and assigned him to an obscure military outpost. He gained notoriety by his bold attacks on the government, his demands for a dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, and for a revision of the constitution. He was deprived of his command in $YEAR$ for coming to Paris twice without leave, and his name was removed from the army list. He was, however, almost at once elected to the chamber for the Nord. The radical socialists, who seek a more democratic republic, joined hands with the Royalists and the Bonapartists, who hope for the overthrow of the republic, in pledging him their support and thus making him a tool in the hands of groups hostile to the existing republican dispensation. A coup d'état seems probable and desirable among his supporters: Boulanger has now become a threat to the parliamentary republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME37254;Boulanger's Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37254;The big opportunity for Boulanger came in $YEAR$ when he was elected in Paris by an overwhelming majority. The victory was clinched by the royalist and radical socialist voters all casting ballots against the republic as constituted. A crowd around 30,000 of his supporters gathered outside the restaurant where Boulanger and his committee awaited the election results. Urged by enthusiasts, the crowd and several within his closest circle called upon Boulanger to lead a march to the presidential palace and stage a coup. There is nothing we can do to stop him if he decides to seize the opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME37255;The Fate of Boulanger;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37255;Boulanger's refusal to lead the coup gave his enemies the time they needed to strike back. Ernest Constans, the Minister of the Interior, decided to investigate the matter, and attacked the League of Patriots using the law banning the activities of secret societies. Shortly afterward the French government issued a warrant for Boulanger's arrest for conspiracy and treasonable activity. To the astonishment of his supporters, he fled Paris before it could be executed, going first to Brussels and then to London. The Parliament stripped him of his immunity from prosecution, the French Senate condemned him and his supporters, Rochefort, and Count Dillon for treason, sentencing all three to deportation and confinement. After his flight, support for him dwindled, and the Boulangists were defeated in the elections. Boulanger himself returned to the Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels to commit suicide by a bullet to the head on the grave of his mistress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME37256;Boulanger's Constitutional Revision;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37256;After defeating all resistance and successfully consolidating his power, Boulanger could finally focus on his promised constitutional revision. The problem is his groups of supporters all have different ideas of what this new constitution should be: the radical socialists seek a a stronger republican government capable of achieving social reforms, the Orléanists want a constitutional monarchy under the Count of Paris, while the Bonapartists want to restore the French Empire. Of course he could always listen to the voices who say he is the only one capable of restoring France to its former glory...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME10412;The Paris Commune;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10412;During the Franco-German War, the people of Paris have prepared for an eventual siege and bought canons, manned by the citizens of the town. The government, fighting off the Germans, asked for the weapons to be seized and fitted with French soldiers, eventually going eastward and making Paris defenseless. As the tension escalated, a large part of the population has formed an autonomous collectivity inside the city, based on communist ideas of equality and council-based governing. While the government stalled, the dissent grew and now other cities share similar situations. A council was formed inside the "Commune of Paris", taking progressive decisions directly inspired by socialist and communist theories. While still preparing for war, they have arranged a society with free press, women participation, mandatory education and welfare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
